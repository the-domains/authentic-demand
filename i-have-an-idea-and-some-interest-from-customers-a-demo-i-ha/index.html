You don't know what plants are poisonous to eat, whether you can drink the water, whether the people you see will help you or try to kill you.  How do you survive? </p><p> That's you wandering around in the investor world.  The first thing you don't know, as you see the natives wandering by on their own mysterious errands, is "what tribe are these people from?"  You don't even know that there's such a thing as a tribe or that you're seeing two different ones.  In this case, you ask about VCs, but you don't know that there's a VC tribe and an angel investor tribe (and maybe a friends and family tribe too.)  You ask about VCs but this doesn't sound like the sort of thing a VC would even consider.  But maybe it's something an angel would consider.   Each tribe has different rituals and sees things differently. </p><p>So you're asking about the wrong tribe, with a question that's almost certainly  the wrong question.  What are the customs of the angel tribe?  How do things look to them?  What do they do every day? Why would they look at your company as potentially fundable?  If you get them to look at it that way, why would they choose to fund it, over the many many alternatives?  Do they care about your lack of a tech person?  Do they care about your lack of personal tech expertise?  Do they care that you're a solo founder?  Do they care about your drive? Do they care that you hired someone to make a demo?  Do they care about the demo?  Do they care about what other people thought when they looked at the demo?   Then, what makes them care about what they care about? why would x matter and y not matter? </p><p> If you want to get anywhere you need to harness your drive to some curiosity about these strange natives and their jungle.  Until you do, whatever you do, it'll be like you wandered up to some random stranger and started yelling at them in a strange language.  They will shrug and walk away.  And you will leave the encounter with no money and with a mistaken conclusion, like "they're narrow minded" or "you can't get anywhere without a tech cofounder."
