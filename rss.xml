            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is it possible to raise seed funding before launching a product?</h1><p>Yes.  As you reduce risks you make it more possible to raise money, and at a higher valuation.  Having an idea doesn't do much to reduce risk.  Having launched a product shows that you've reduced the risk that you weren't actually able to produce a product.  Having launched a product that's selling well reduces a lot more risk.  Before you do that, you can reduce risks by having team members who've done it before, through prototypes, and through some kind of market validation that appears valid to the investor.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why should a CEO deserve more equity than a co-founder acting as a consultant?</h1><p>Think of a startup company as a journey or adventure. Whose adventure is it?  Who is the protagonist of this story?  Normally it's the CEO.  Investors, particularly angels, are people who want to accompany the protagonist on their journey. One thing they're interested in is that the protagonist is committed to making the journey, pushing forward wherever it leads (unless/until it's absolutely clear that it leads nowhere.) That's why you need a CEO and that's why the CEO is incented with a stake in the company. </p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[I'm a technical founder.  How much equity should I give up to investors?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>I'm a technical founder.  How much equity should I give up to investors?</h1><p>The key here is to think of this not in terms of what's right for you or for the investors, but what's right for the company.  This is too much equity for a first investor, and will probably kill your business. The cap table will be lopsided and new investors won't come in later. However, it's likely that the issue here is not really equity but control.
The details you provide indicate that you're thinking as a technical person rather than a business person.  This is a challenge for an investor, because he or she will know that without a leader who's talented, focused, and experienced on the business side your company will fail no matter how useful the technology might be. 
So,  if I was an expert in your area and loved the technology so much that I didn't want to miss the opportunity, I'd want controlling interest in the company so I had control over your business decisions. 
There are two scenarios where this might make sense, and one (more likely) scenario where it doesn't. 
The investor comes in to run the business as a cofounder.  They might be the right person and partner to do that. 
It's a strategic investor, a company that already makes and sells similar products; they're essentially buying your technology and adding it to their portfolio.
The investor thinks you might be an ok CEO, but they don't trust you in that role and want to be able to make the decisions and tell you what to do.
Scenario three will probably lead to failure.  Scenarios 1 and 2 could work, depending on you.
Your alternative options include:
Find a business cofounder yourself, work together for a while, and then raise money.
Convince another investor that you're a good business person to run this.
Propose a deal to this investor that they get less equity but get preferred shares in a structure that gives them control.
If you're like most people, you'll prefer #1 or #2, but it's worth listening to investors who think you're not the right person to run the company.  One of my most successful investments was a company with a great technical founder, and also a great salesman, who investors did not believe would be a good CEO.  Part of how he convinced investors to come in was by demoting himself to chief scientist and bringing in a CEO.  That showed maturity, knowledge of his strengths and weaknesses, humility, and an ability to work with people.</p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Can you ask prospective customers how much they will pay for your product?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Can you ask prospective customers how much they will pay for your product?</h1><p>To the extent that a product is actually innovative, there probably is none.  Behavioral economists have shown that supposedly irrelevant factors are strong determinants of what people say when you ask them how much they'll pay for something.  For example, in one study, subjects were checked into the room and, for identification, asked for the last two digits of their social security numbers.  They were then asked how much they would pay for a series of items, things like a computer mouse that they wouldn't necessarily have a price in mind for.  In a subsequent study another group was given money (play money I think) and asked to bid on items.
What consistently happens is that the people with social security numbers that happened to have a higher last two digits, like 72 rather than 27, would say they'd pay higher, and would bid higher.  Just the fact that they said the number beforehand,  a number that was completely irrelevant to the price of the object, strongly influenced their choices.  This and similar experiments have been repeated many times.
Answers get even more unreliable if you add other biasing factors.  Like the questioner has a number in mind, or a group of people hear each other's answers, or the questioner proposes some possible prices, or those prices are offered in the same order each time.
Bottom line: If you ask people how much they'll pay for things, the science says that their answers will be unreliable. 
You will have better luck looking at comparable products and what people are paying for them now. But that gets back to my first point:  to the extent that the product is innovative, and therefore different from things they know about, comparables won't work.</p></article>]]></description>
