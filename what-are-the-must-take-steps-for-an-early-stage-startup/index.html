The problem is that startups, to have any chance of succeeding, must attach to the world of their customers in an innovative way.  The other two options - attaching to the world of the customers in a known, tried and true way, or not attaching at all - are both failure paths.   If you do it in a tried and true way, then your business is a minnow in direct competition with whales.  Your competitors have a thousand times your resources, experience, relationships, brand value, customer habit, money, technology know-how, etcetera, and you have nothing special.  You can make this work in a protected little niche, or for a while, but it doesn't scale and isn't safe. </p><p> Not attaching at all is worse. There are at least 4,000 startups in the Silicon Valley area right now, and nearly all of them will fail, and nearly all for this reason - nobody really cares.  For the most part, they're struggling and failing, to find "product market fit."  But product market fit is itself a serious misconception.  People are not sets of requirements and products are not objects that meet those requirements.  Attaching to a market is something entirely different from matching products features to needs or desires. </p><p> So, to make a successful startup, you've got to attach in an innovative way.  What are the steps to that?  

There aren't any steps.  That attachment, if it exists, is something that isn't known.  And since its location isn't known, the steps to it can't be predetermined.  What you can do; the best you can do, is to put yourself in a position to uncover the secrets of the market, and act in such a way to uncover them. 

One way to put yourself in that position is to have worked in the business, so you have the experience to recognize the things you find.  Another way is to know how to create things that are bought in that market, so you know what they technologies can and can't do and how to make them.  Another is to work with partners who can check your assumptions and notice when you're not noticing.

The practice is something else, and would take a long explanation.  That's what we do at Flashpoint.</p></div></section></div><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="24"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="25"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="26"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="27"><span data-reactid="28"><!-- react-empty: 29 --><h2 data-reactid="30"><a data-reactid="31">What are the &quot;must take&quot; steps for an early stage startup?</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="34"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="35"></div></section></div></div>
