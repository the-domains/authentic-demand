Spend all of your startup time trying to figure out the customers.  You&#x27;ve got to learn a secret about them.  Not the thing they think is cool or useful. Not the thing they say they want - the secret isn&#x27;t about an object, it&#x27;s about them.  It can&#x27;t be discovered by asking them.  It can&#x27;t be discovered by showing them an MVP and gauging their reaction.  It&#x27;ll take the following form: How they go about being who they are, is this.  They are prevented from being that thing by this.  

Ultimately, your product will be the thing that overcomes the thing that prevents them from being who they are.  If this is your product, it will reliably find traction.  The reaction this type of product gets is &quot;authentic demand.  But don&#x27;t worry about that at the beginning.  Thinking about product first screws you up.  

Most people will answer you with a trick or an inspirational story, or direct you to Ben Horowitz&#x27;s book.    But the answer isn&#x27;t perseverance.  Persevering with a product that won&#x27;t sell reliably is a mistake.  Save your perseverance for working on understanding the customer until you really do.  Use your perseverance to stop yourself from just going with something that you think will work.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="6" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-large p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="57"><div class="Component ls-fx-r p-1 " data-reactid="58"><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 color-title fx-2" data-reactid="59"><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="60"><h1 data-reactid="61"><span class=" color-box-pop" data-reactid="62"><a class="font-title" data-reactid="63">What are the &quot;must take&quot; steps for an early stage startup?</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 64 --><!-- react-empty: 65 --></div><div class="Group Group--textual p-1 color-text fx-1" data-reactid="66"><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="67"><p data-reactid="68">This is a fantastic question, but an unanswerable one.  The problem is that startups, to have any chance of succeeding, must attach to the world of their customers in an innovative way.  The other two options - attaching to the world of the customers in a known, tried and true way, or not attaching at all - are both failure paths.   If you do it in a tried and true way, then your business is a minnow in direct competition with whales.  Your competitors have a thousand times your resources, experience, relationships, brand value, customer habit, money, technology know-how, etcetera, and you have nothing special.  You can make this work in a protected little niche, or for a while, but it doesn&#x27;t scale and isn&#x27;t safe. </p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="69"><p data-reactid="70"> Not attaching at all is worse. There are at least 4,000 startups in the Silicon Valley area right now, and nearly all of them will fail, and nearly all for this reason - nobody really cares.  For the most part, they&#x27;re struggling and failing, to find &quot;product market fit.&quot;  But product market fit is itself a serious misconception.  People are not sets of requirements and products are not objects that meet those requirements.  Attaching to a market is something entirely different from matching products features to needs or desires. </p></div></div></div></section><section id="8" class="Section Section--components-2 color-title title-size-medium  color-bg text-align-left  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="71"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-2 " data-reactid="72"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px max-w-768px p-1 color-title" data-reactid="73"><!-- react-empty: 74 --><!-- react-empty: 75 --><!-- react-empty: 76 --><!-- react-empty: 77 --><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="78"><p data-reactid="79">What numbers should be included in a pitch deck?</p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="80"><p data-reactid="81">1.

Sometimes, with startups, you can&#x27;t afford the shovel but you can convince the store owner to sell it to you for a stake.

This is too much equity for a first investor, and will probably kill your business. The cap table will be lopsided and new investors won&#x27;t come in later. However, it&#x27;s likely that the issue here is not really equity but control.
The details you provide indicate that you&#x27;re thinking as a technical person rather than a business person.  This is a challenge for an investor, because he or she will know that without a leader who&#x27;s talented, focused, and experienced on the business side your company will fail no matter how useful the technology might be. 
So,  if I was an expert in your area and loved the technology so much that I didn&#x27;t want to miss the opportunity, I&#x27;d want controlling interest in the company so I had control over your business decisions. 
There are two scenarios where this might make sense, and one (more likely) scenario where it doesn&#x27;t. 
The investor comes in to run the business as a cofounder.  They might be the right person and partner to do that. 
It&#x27;s a strategic investor, a company that already makes and sells similar products; they&#x27;re essentially buying your technology and adding it to their portfolio.
The investor thinks you might be an ok CEO, but they don&#x27;t trust you in that role and want to be able to make the decisions and tell you what to do.
Scenario three will probably lead to failure.  Scenarios 1 and 2 could work, depending on you.
Your alternative options include:
Find a business cofounder yourself, work together for a while, and then raise money.
Convince another investor that you&#x27;re a good business person to run this.
Propose a deal to this investor that they get less equity but get preferred shares in a structure that gives them control.
If you&#x27;re like most people, you&#x27;ll prefer #1 or #2, but it&#x27;s worth listening to investors who think you&#x27;re not the right person to run the company.  One of my most successful investments was a company with a great technical founder, and also a great salesman, who investors did not believe would be a good CEO.  Part of how he convinced investors to come in was by demoting himself to chief scientist and bringing in a CEO.  That showed maturity, knowledge of his strengths and weaknesses, humility, and an ability to work with people.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="15" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-large p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="168"><div class="Component ls-fx-r p-1 " data-reactid="169"><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 color-title fx-2" data-reactid="170"><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="171"><h1 data-reactid="172"><span class=" color-box-pop" data-reactid="173"><a class="font-title" data-reactid="174">Can you ask prospective customers how much they will pay for your product?</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 175 --><!-- react-empty: 176 --></div><div class="Group Group--textual p-1 color-text fx-1" data-reactid="177"><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="178"><p data-reactid="179">To the extent that a product is actually innovative, there probably is none.  Behavioral economists have shown that supposedly irrelevant factors are strong determinants of what people say when you ask them how much they&#x27;ll pay for something.  For example, in one study, subjects were checked into the room and, for identification, asked for the last two digits of their social security numbers.  They were then asked how much they would pay for a series of items, things like a computer mouse that they wouldn&#x27;t necessarily have a price in mind for.  In a subsequent study another group was given money (play money I think) and asked to bid on items.
What consistently happens is that the people with social security numbers that happened to have a higher last two digits, like 72 rather than 27, would say they&#x27;d pay higher, and would bid higher.  Just the fact that they said the number beforehand,  a number that was completely irrelevant to the price of the object, strongly influenced their choices.  This and similar experiments have been repeated many times.
Answers get even more unreliable if you add other biasing factors.  Like the questioner has a number in mind, or a group of people hear each other&#x27;s answers, or the questioner proposes some possible prices, or those prices are offered in the same order each time.
Bottom line: If you ask people how much they&#x27;ll pay for things, the science says that their answers will be unreliable. 
You will have better luck looking at comparable products and what people are paying for them now. But that gets back to my first point:  to the extent that the product is innovative, and therefore different from things they know about, comparables won&#x27;t work.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="16" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-large p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="180"><div class="Component ls-fx-r p-1 " data-reactid="181"><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 color-title fx-2" data-reactid="182"><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="183"><h1 data-reactid="184"><span class=" color-box-pop" data-reactid="185"><a class="font-title" data-reactid="186">My startup looks perfect: innovative product, traction, great business plan, but angels won&#x27;t fund it.  What&#x27;s wrong with them?</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 187 --><!-- react-empty: 188 --></div><div class="Group Group--textual p-1 color-text fx-1" data-reactid="189"><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="190"><p data-reactid="191">To get funded, you need to look fundable.

Suppose I said &quot;I have a great book I want to write, it contains five thousand instances of the word &quot;the,&quot; and the sentence &quot;I can answer this question.&quot;   Will you give me an advance to write the book?  If you were a book publisher, you&#x27;d say that that&#x27;s not enough information to base a decision on.  Startups are like that.  No one knows how customers or partners or competitors will react before they react.  Even when they do react, you don&#x27;t know why, so you can&#x27;t rely on them to continue reacting in the same way over time.  You&#x27;ve got very little data.
So you&#x27;ve put the available data together in a way that makes the company look good, and they haven&#x27;t.  If you want them to invest their money you have to understand what things look like from their perspective.</p></div></div></div></section></div><section id="17" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="192"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="193"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="194"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="195"><span data-reactid="196"><!-- react-empty: 197 --><h2 data-reactid="198"><a data-reactid="199">Startups for the Small Investor</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="200"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="201"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="202"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="203"></div></section></div></div>

Before you do that, you can reduce risks by having team members who've done it before, through prototypes, and through some kind of market validation that appears valid to the investor."}]},"154419ee-becb-47ec-8304-bcb5a2c01f86":{"id":"154419ee-becb-47ec-8304-bcb5a2c01f86","index":9,"created_by":"a0e8d2d6-0e88-434a-af1e-2af2ac9bbfdc","updated_by":null,"created_at":"2016-03-21T19:10:37.098Z","updated_at":null,"published":true,"score":0,"path":"_posts/2016-03-21-what-do-investors-think-of-kanye-wests-dollar1-billion-ask.md","_title":"What do investors think of Kanye West's $1 Billion \"ask?\"","metadata":{"@type":"Article","url":"what-do-investors-think-of-kanye-wests-dollar1-billion-ask/index.html","inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":true,"inNav":false,"title":"What do investors think of Kanye West's $1 Billion \"ask?\"","keywords":[]},"content":[{"id":"37a8b7e9-3a05-42a0-882f-42d9a8451cfe","item":"154419ee-becb-47ec-8304-bcb5a2c01f86","type":"h1","html":"<h1>What do investors think of Kanye West's $1 Billion \"ask?\"</h1>","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":true,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"keywords":[]},"text":"What do investors think of Kanye West's $1 Billion \"ask?\""},{"id":"1e46a4ee-2908-4fe8-ac3e-766b6c8e8591","item":"154419ee-becb-47ec-8304-bcb5a2c01f86","type":"text","html":"<p>I'm much too small an investor to be one of those being asked.

But that gets back to my first point:  to the extent that the product is innovative, and therefore different from things they know about, comparables won't work."}]},"be88e929-3102-43c2-8b18-1412e4bfbca4":{"id":"be88e929-3102-43c2-8b18-1412e4bfbca4","index":15,"created_by":"a0e8d2d6-0e88-434a-af1e-2af2ac9bbfdc","updated_by":"a0e8d2d6-0e88-434a-af1e-2af2ac9bbfdc","created_at":"2016-03-21T18:47:56.601Z","updated_at":"2016-03-21T18:48:17.945Z","published":true,"score":0,"path":"_posts/2016-03-21-my-startup-looks-perfect-innovative-product-traction-grea.md","_title":"My startup looks perfect: innovative product, traction, great business plan, but angels won't fund it.  What's wrong with them?","metadata":{"@type":"Article","url":"my-startup-looks-perfect-innovative-product-traction-grea/index.html","inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":true,"inNav":false,"title":"My startup looks perfect: innovative product, traction, great business plan, but angels won't fund it.  What's wrong with them?","description":"To get funded, you need to look fundable.
