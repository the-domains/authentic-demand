# Authentic demand: The ?

The word "authentic" is meant to raise a question. Is there something that startup founders see or experience, that appears to be demand but isn't?  

The answer isn't just yes, it's that that experience is ubiquitous. Suppose a prospective customer describes what she wants.  Is that authentic demand?  Suppose a survey shows the product features respondents say they care about most.  Is that authentic demand?

Look at yourself, and look at the people around you.  Are there things you want that you don't buy?  Are there things you buy that you don't want?  "Wanting" something, much less claiming that you will buy it in the future, is singularly unreliable.  Product/market fit is also next to useless.  Retrospectively, we look at products that were successful and see how they fit the market, and we look at unsuccessful products and imagine that they don't.  But within a plausible range, you can't look at two prospective products and reliably forecast which one will prove to fit the market.

Authentic demand is a search through behavior economics, neuropsychology, phenomenology, ethnomethodology, and other disciplines in an attempt to discover a reliable way to understand customers and markets.
