# How do seed investors decide whether a company will become a unicorn?

Well, here's how I try to do it:
Act like Odysseus passing the sirens.\*

Odysseus knew he couldn't resist them, and they'd lead him to ruin. So he made arrangements to protect himself from their song. He had himself tied to the mast, stopped up the ears of his oarsmen, and gave them orders to keep rowing no matter what. 

In an investment context, here's what I know:
There are lots of things that will bias me toward or away from a particular company. I can imagine the idea working, the founder strikes me as well put together, customers say they love the product, I once had a similar idea and wished I'd pursued it, it reminds me of Uber.... I know that none of these things actually correlate with the eventual failure or success of the company. I also know that they seem to me like perfectly good reasons. Even though I know they're not important, I can't help feeling that they've given me a real bead on the future of the company. So I've got to take steps to hold myself back and avoid being swayed by these biases. 

I know that, as an angel investor looking at a seed round, there cannot be enough information about the business to give me a meaningful answer. VC firms looking at A rounds have much more information because the companies are more mature. They have all the resources in the world to spend on due diligence and expertise in the space. They're mostly smarter than me. But even they usually fail to pick winners. Only about a third of their investments ever return money, and a tiny fraction of the companies they invest in really take off. So if they can't figure it out, what hope do I have?
I know that filtering works very badly. Sure there are red flags, like people lying, or founders already fighting, or business plans that point to too-small markets. But even the best process that filters out all the red-flagged companies will leave a pool too large to invest in, and most of them will fail too. Plus, some of the red-flagged companies will succeed. 

The one thing I can look for, and that I that correlates most with eventual success, is that the founders are doing the work. By that I mean are they searching, in a meaningful way, for authentic demand from customers. By "meaningful way," I do not mean that potential customers say the product's great and they'll buy it as soon as you make it. Most of what gets called "validation" in this business is actually just confirmation bias. Or a combination of that and people helpfully imagining what they might do in some future situation, which is not what they will actually do.
I don't want to see founders doing that kind of validation. I want to see that they're trying to do what scientists do: actively attempting to disconfirm a theory about the customer as a way to validate it. Identifying variables that make the experiment useless and getting rid of them. Keeping a careful watch on the lines between what they know and don't know.
Founders doing that kind of work are much more likely to, at some point, find the kernel of a new business that can be relied on.
