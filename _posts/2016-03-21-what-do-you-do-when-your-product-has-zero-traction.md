# What do you do when your product has zero traction?

Except in a case where you've inherited responsibility for someone else's product, you should never have a product with zero traction. 
Spend all of your startup time trying to figure out the customers. You've got to learn a secret about them. Not the thing they think is cool or useful. Not the thing they say they want - the secret isn't about an object, it's about them. It can't be discovered by asking them. It can't be discovered by showing them an MVP and gauging their reaction. It'll take the following form: How they go about being who they are, is this. They are prevented from being that thing by this. 
Ultimately, your product will be the thing that overcomes the thing that prevents them from being who they are. If this is your product, it will reliably find traction. The reaction this type of product gets is "authentic demand. But don't worry about that at the beginning. Thinking about product first screws you up. 
Most people will answer you with a trick or an inspirational story, or direct you to Ben Horowitz's book. But the answer isn't perseverance. Persevering with a product that won't sell reliably is a mistake. Save your perseverance for working on understanding the customer until you really do. Use your perseverance to stop yourself from just going with something that you think will work.
