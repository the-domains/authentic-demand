# Can capitalist societies overcome poverty?

Absolutely! 

But not relatively. 

Capitalism always includes some level of variance between economic winners and losers. That variance can be very wide, like in the US today, or fairly narrow, like in the nordic versions. So inequality is always an issue. But in absolute terms, the poorest people in developed capitalist countries are much better off (economically at least) than poor people in less developed countries. Poverty in the nordic versions of capitalism, and even in other European capitalist models, and even, even in the US, is a lot more livable than in it used to be, and trend will probably continue. I'm not arguing that a poor person in the US isn't genuinely poor, but it's a less pernicious form of poverty than the one you find in in sub-Saharan Africa or South Asia.
Maybe a better framing of the question would be "does capitalism depend on having some people in poverty, or inevitably force some people into poverty?" These are theoretical possibilities:
- Corporations could only operate successfully if they had access to low wage workers.
- The owners of capital could maximize profitability by driving down wages until their workers were all poor.
- The competition that drives capitalism could fade away if no one was really poor.
The first and second points seem to be real factors, but not overwhelming ones. Other factors, like the greater productivity of higher paid workers, seem to overwhelm them. The third one seems to be a fantasy - people will compete despite their economic level.
