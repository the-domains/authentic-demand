# I'm a technical founder.  How much equity should I give up to investors?

The key here is to think of this not in terms of what's right for you or for the investors, but what's right for the company. This is too much equity for a first investor, and will probably kill your business. The cap table will be lopsided and new investors won't come in later. However, it's likely that the issue here is not really equity but control.
The details you provide indicate that you're thinking as a technical person rather than a business person. This is a challenge for an investor, because he or she will know that without a leader who's talented, focused, and experienced on the business side your company will fail no matter how useful the technology might be. 
So, if I was an expert in your area and loved the technology so much that I didn't want to miss the opportunity, I'd want controlling interest in the company so I had control over your business decisions. 
There are two scenarios where this might make sense, and one (more likely) scenario where it doesn't. 
The investor comes in to run the business as a cofounder. They might be the right person and partner to do that. 
It's a strategic investor, a company that already makes and sells similar products; they're essentially buying your technology and adding it to their portfolio.
The investor thinks you might be an ok CEO, but they don't trust you in that role and want to be able to make the decisions and tell you what to do.
Scenario three will probably lead to failure. Scenarios 1 and 2 could work, depending on you.
Your alternative options include:
Find a business cofounder yourself, work together for a while, and then raise money.
Convince another investor that you're a good business person to run this.
Propose a deal to this investor that they get less equity but get preferred shares in a structure that gives them control.
If you're like most people, you'll prefer \#1 or \#2, but it's worth listening to investors who think you're not the right person to run the company. One of my most successful investments was a company with a great technical founder, and also a great salesman, who investors did not believe would be a good CEO. Part of how he convinced investors to come in was by demoting himself to chief scientist and bringing in a CEO. That showed maturity, knowledge of his strengths and weaknesses, humility, and an ability to work with people.
