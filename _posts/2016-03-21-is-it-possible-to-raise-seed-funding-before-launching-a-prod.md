# Is it possible to raise seed funding before launching a product?

Yes. As you reduce risks you make it more possible to raise money, and at a higher valuation. Having an idea doesn't do much to reduce risk. Having launched a product shows that you've reduced the risk that you weren't actually able to produce a product. Having launched a product that's selling well reduces a lot more risk. Before you do that, you can reduce risks by having team members who've done it before, through prototypes, and through some kind of market validation that appears valid to the investor.
