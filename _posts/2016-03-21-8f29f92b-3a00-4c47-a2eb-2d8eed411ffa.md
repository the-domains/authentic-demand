What numbers should be included in a pitch deck?

1\. The metrics (maybe 2 or 3) by which you're judging growth or are planning to judge growth. If it's not an obvious one like revenue then an explanation of why these are the important metrics. 

2\. Your burn rate and expected post-funding burn rate, primarily the number of people and their costs. 

3\. Your target market size. Emphasis here is on "your" - not the total size of, e.g. the trucking market, but the size of the segment of that market you address directly. At the seed stage, this is more about avoiding markets that can't plausibly be big enough, and about giving the potential investors access to your thinking about who you can sell to. (So don't make promises about future growth based on percentages of that market, because that's two orders of speculation and won't be believed.)
