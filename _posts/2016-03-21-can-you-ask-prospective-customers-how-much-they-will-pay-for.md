# Can you ask prospective customers how much they will pay for your product?

To the extent that a product is actually innovative, there probably is none. Behavioral economists have shown that supposedly irrelevant factors are strong determinants of what people say when you ask them how much they'll pay for something. For example, in one study, subjects were checked into the room and, for identification, asked for the last two digits of their social security numbers. They were then asked how much they would pay for a series of items, things like a computer mouse that they wouldn't necessarily have a price in mind for. In a subsequent study another group was given money (play money I think) and asked to bid on items.
What consistently happens is that the people with social security numbers that happened to have a higher last two digits, like 72 rather than 27, would say they'd pay higher, and would bid higher. Just the fact that they said the number beforehand, a number that was completely irrelevant to the price of the object, strongly influenced their choices. This and similar experiments have been repeated many times.
Answers get even more unreliable if you add other biasing factors. Like the questioner has a number in mind, or a group of people hear each other's answers, or the questioner proposes some possible prices, or those prices are offered in the same order each time.
Bottom line: If you ask people how much they'll pay for things, the science says that their answers will be unreliable. 
You will have better luck looking at comparable products and what people are paying for them now. But that gets back to my first point: to the extent that the product is innovative, and therefore different from things they know about, comparables won't work.
