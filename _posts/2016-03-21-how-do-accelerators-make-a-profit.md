# How do accelerators make a profit?

Most accelerators lose money. The revenue producing models fall into a few categories: 

**Real estate deals.** Lots of accelerators are mini-workspaces. They charge companies to attend by renting desks, they offer community, amenities like coffee bars, talks by mentors, and they hope to (or pretend to) rent a lot of space to startups when they succeed. Plus, they attract actual tenants to the building with the prospect of being around an accelerator. 

**Sponsorships.** Some accelerators get large companies to pay their costs. This can mean lots of companies sponsoring the coffee bar, the demo day, etcetera, or it can be captive to one big company. The sponsors get proximity to something cool, a thing to photograph for their annual report, a chance to expose employees to young people, and a chance for recruiters to pick over the founders or acqui-hire. 

**A piece of the action**. Most accelerators offer some level of investment for some level of equity. There are very few examples of this working, and when it does, it's usually because the fund that's putting money into the startups is a piece of a larger fund that can keep putting more money into the winners, if any.
Classes. Some accelerators offer training in startup related things, like UI design. 

**Studio. ** Some accelerators are started by people with money, generally ones who've been successful at building companies, in order to make their own companies. This rarely works, but in some cases, like Idealab, it does.

Note: If you're a founder and are actually interested in building a successful company, try to avoid sponsorship type accelerators and be very wary of the real estate ones.  The incentives of the accelerator owners are not aligned with yours.  You are basically there as entertainment for the paying customers.
