# Why should a CEO deserve more equity than a co-founder acting as a consultant?

Think of a startup company as a journey or adventure. Whose adventure is it? Who is the protagonist of this story? Normally it's the CEO. Investors, particularly angels, are people who want to accompany the protagonist on their journey. One thing they're interested in is that the protagonist is committed to making the journey, pushing forward wherever it leads (unless/until it's absolutely clear that it leads nowhere.) That's why you need a CEO and that's why the CEO is incented with a stake in the company. 

A consultant is someone who is paid for supporting the journey, someone who sells the gold miners their shovels and tents and maps and pants. Shovel store owners go broke when they provide shovels, which they paid for, in return for a stake in the possible riches. They want to be paid cash for their shovels. Sometimes, with startups, you can't afford the shovel but you can convince the store owner to sell it to you for a stake. Ok, do what you have to do, but the store owners don't like it, and the investors don't like sharing their possible win with a guy who's just selling shovels and isn't coming along.
